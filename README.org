Beamer template
===============
With a little work using a text editor and image manipulation it can be adapted to your own needs.

Beamer template using University of Warwick, UK, official colours and logos. This theme is based on the theme by [[http://www.drbunsen.org/designing-a-beamer-template-theme/][Dr. Bunsen]]. 
When compiling you need to use XeTeX since I use a non standard font (Fontin Sans), but if you comment out that section you can compile it with pdflatex as well.
