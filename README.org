#+TITLE: Beamer template

With a little work using a text editor and image manipulation it can be adapted to your own needs.

Beamer template using University of Warwick, UK, official colours and logos. This theme is based on the theme by [[http://www.drbunsen.org/designing-a-beamer-template-theme/][Dr. Bunsen]].

* Usage
  
  When compiling you need to use XeTeX since I use a non standard font (Fontin Sans), but if you comment out that section you can compile it with pdflatex as well.
  

** Changing title page
   The title page background is saved as a png, use [[file:pics/frontpage_bg.svg][frontpage_bg.svg]] and use the right ratios to change it. The title location is adjusted for it.

** Slide header
   The header for slides is saved under [[file:pics/slideBgWhite.png][slideBgWhite]] or [[file:pics/slideBg.png][slideBg]]. Use =\usetheme{warwick}= or =\usetheme{warwickWhite}=, for the blue or white background respectively. 

*** Downloads
Feel free to fork or clone the project. You can also download the zip file, [[https://github.com/anasrana/beamer-template/archive/master.zip][here]].
